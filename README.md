## Introduction

LatentUQ aims to provide tools and methods for uncertainty quantification in machine learning models. It leverages Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), latent space modeling, and sampling techniques to achieve robust and reliable uncertainty estimates.

## Features

- Implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Sampling techniques including Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA)
- Data handling and preprocessing utilities
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Configurable and extensible codebase

## Installation

To install the LatentUQ package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rg625/LatentUQ.git
    cd LatentUQ
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
